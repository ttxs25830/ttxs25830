### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some projects about screeps, like my bot and an npm package for it's api, also i'm trying to make some websites, but i just got no talent at ui design.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning rust and c, and golang is also in my list.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with arch linux, as i'm switching my develop computer from ubuntu to arch.
- âš¡ Fun fact: If you heard a joke, then you have heard a joke before!ğŸ˜®
